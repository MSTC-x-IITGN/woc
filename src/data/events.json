This technique involves two primary components: a content image (like a photograph) and a style image (typically an artwork). By employing a pre-trained CNN, such as VGG19, the model extracts feature representations of both content and style. The goal is to minimize the content and style losses, where the content loss ensures the output image retains the original content's structure, and the style loss infuses the artistic elements from the style image. This optimization process iteratively updates the output image, effectively 'transferring' the artistic style onto the content image, resulting in a unique, aesthetically blended creation.
